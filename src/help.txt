Usage:
  esbuild-dev [--import] [--cjs] [--watch] [--plugin:name] main.ts ...
  esbuild-dev external [--bare] main.ts ...
  esbuild-dev temp

Options:
  --import              Use `--import` to run the file, which is helpful when
  alias: --loader       using other coverage tools. In this mode, plugins are
                        not supported.

  --no-warnings         Using experimental loader api will cause node
                        print warnings. Set this flag to turn off them all.
                        This is only a temporary workaround to please eyes.

  --cjs                 Change the output file format to CJS.
                        Same as `--format=cjs`.

  --cwd=...             Set the current working directory, it also affects the
                        logic to find the temp directory.

  --shims               Replace `import.meta.url` and `__dirname` with absolute
                        path in .[tj]s files. This is enabled by default.
                        You can pass `--shims=false` to disable it.

  --cache               Skip build if the output file is newer than the input.
                        It is disabled by default.

  --watch               Enable watch mode. This is built on top of the
  alias: -w             `context.watch()` function of esbuild.

  --plugin:name         Load esbuild plugins. For example, `--plugin:style`
  alias: -p             will try to load `style` package in your project.
                        Names with relative path will be bundled first.

  --include:name        Include module in the bundle (can use * wildcards).

  --exclude:name        Exclude module from the bundle (can use * wildcards).
                        If `--include` is not specified, all paths will be
                        included by default.

  --node:options        Append node options to the command line. For example,
                        `--node:--env-file=.env` will result in the final
                        command be `node --env-file=.env outfile.js`.

  --[esbuild-options]   Additional flags left of the filename will be passed
                        to esbuild build options.

Sub Commands:
  external              Show potential external libraries of a file.
                        Additional arguments are passed to build options.
                        This command uses a custom resolve plugin to scan
                        and gather all package name imports and exclude them.

    --bare              Use bare format (one name per line, no quotes).
    alias: -b

    --include:name      Include module in the bundle (can use * wildcards).

    --exclude:name      Exclude module from the bundle (can use * wildcards).
                        If `--include` is not specified, all paths will be
                        included by default.

  temp                  Show the temp directory of the current project.
  alias: tmp

    --cwd=...           Set the current working directory.
