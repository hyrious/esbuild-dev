Usage:
  esbuild-dev [--import] [--cjs] [--watch] [--plugin:name] main.ts ...
  esbuild-dev external [--bare] main.ts ...
  esbuild-dev temp

Options:
  --import              Use `--import` to run the file, which is helpful
  alias: --loader       when using other coverage tools.
                        In this mode, plugins are not supported.

  --no-warnings         Using experimental loader api will cause node
                        print warnings. Set this flag to turn off them all.
                        This is only a temporary workaround to please eyes.

  --cjs                 Change the outfile format to CJS. For example,
                        `__dirname` can only be used in CJS, and
                        `import.meta` can only be accessed in ESM.
                        This option cannot be used with `--import`.

  --shims               Replace `import.meta.url` and `__dirname` with absolute
                        path in .[tj]s files. This is enabled by default.

  --watch               Enable watch mode. This is built on top of the
  alias: -w             `context.watch()` function of esbuild.

  --plugin:name         Load esbuild plugins. For example, `--plugin:style`
  alias: -p             will try to load `style` package in your project.
                        Names with relative path will be bundled first.

  --include:name        Force include a package in the bundle.

  --node:node-options   Append node options to the command line. For example,
                        `--node:--env-file=.env` will result in the final
                        command be `node --env-file=.env outfile.js`.

  --[esbuild-options]   Additional flags left of the filename will be passed
                        to esbuild build options.

Sub Commands:
  external              Show potential external libraries of a file.
                        Additional arguments are passed to build options.
                        This command uses a custom resolve plugin to scan
                        and gather all package name imports and exclude them.

    --bare              Use bare format (one name per line, no quotes).
    alias: -b

  temp                  Show the temp directory of the current project.
